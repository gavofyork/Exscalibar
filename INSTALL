Building the Exscalibar software
--------------------------------

Exscalibar is developed under Linux on the x86 platform. However Qt, one of two
required dependancies is multiplatform. Qt version 4.0 or above is required. Newmat, the other required dependency should also be cross-platform.

The qmake file requires a Unix environment with grep, sed and awk available.

Geddei currently uses libsndfile, libmad and libvorbisfile for sound file
I/O, and can use Jack and ALSA for audio I/O. GeddeiNite will not build without
libsndfile.

Exscalibar uses the Qt qmake building system and thus is fairly simple to build
regardless of system/architecture. Essentially you should just use:

	qmake -r && make && sudo make install

If you wish to install Exscalibar somewhere other than the default location
(i.e. where Qt is installed), then alter install PREFIX with qmake's -set option.
For example to change the installation prefix to /usr/local before building and
installing, you would run the following:

	qmake -set EXSCALIBAR_PREFIX /usr/local

It is highly recommended to use FFTW; it will seriously improve the speed of any
Fourier transforms. Assuming version 3 or above is found on your system you
it should be discovered automatically.

You should also have libsndfile, libmad and libvorbisfile on your system, which
facilitates reading .wav, .mp3 and .ogg audio files.

That's it. You should make sure the Exscalibar libraries cvan be accessed by the
dynamic linker. If you didn't set a different EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION, then you
shouldn't have to do anything special, since it will ride on the back of your Qt
setup. Otherwise, you'll probably have to add $EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION/lib to
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your default environment:

(Editing ~/.profile: )
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Software/exscalibar

Enjoy!
