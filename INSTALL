Building the Exscalibar software
--------------------------------

Exscalibar is developed under Linux on the x86 platform. However Qt, its only
required dependancy is multiplatform. Qt version 3.2 or above is required, which
for Windows users will be a problem until Trolltech release version 4.0 of Qt,
which will have a Free Windows version.

Currently Exscalibar supports only Qt with a major version of 3. Supporting later
versions and other platforms will be made available in due course. The configure
script requires an 'sh' shell interpreter.

Geddei currently uses libsndfile, libmad and libvorbisfile for sound file
I/O, and can use Jack and ALSA for audio I/O. GeddeiNite may not build without
libsndfile.

Exscalibar uses the Qt qmake building system and thus is fairly simple to build
regardless of system/architecture. A simple configure script is provided to
detect what software your system has and prepare the build options. So before
building you must run (in the build root):

	./configure

If you wish to install Exscalibar somewhere other than the default location (the
Qt path, $QTDIR), you must explicitly set $EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION before
running ./configure. Example:

	EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION=~/Software/exscalibar ./configure

This must always be in the environment when using Exscalibar or Exscalibar-based
applications. The simplest way to do this is to insert the appropriate line into
your ~/.profile:

(Editing ~/.profile: )
	export EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION=~/Software/exscalibar

It is highly recommended to use FFTW; it will seriously improve the speed of any
Fourier transforms. Assuming version 3 or above is found on your system you
it should be discovered automatically. FFTW can be found at the FFTW home.

You should also have libsndfile, libmad and libvorbisfile on your system, which
facilitates reading .wav, .mp3 and .ogg audio files.

As Exscalibar uses the Qt build system, it can be built by using the Makefile
"make". Installing it all just takes "make install", though if installing to a
system location (like $QTDIR often is), you'll need to be the superuser first:

	make && su -c make install

That's it. You should make sure the Exscalibar libraries cvan be accessed by the
dynamic linker. If you didn't set a different EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION, then you
shouldn't have to do anything special, since it will ride on the back of your Qt
setup. Otherwise, you'll probably have to add $EXSCALIBAR_LOCATION/lib to
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your default environment:

(Editing ~/.profile: )
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Software/exscalibar

Enjoy!
