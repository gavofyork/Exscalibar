Bigger ports.
Show future link.
Change MultiPort to M.
Allow dragging of subprocs around.
Graphical glitches.

Allow properties to be declared run-time and edited within processor.

ALSACapturer to have squares for buffers & hollow for missed.

Latcher - possibly as part of core (e.g. dump all samples on line except more recent - always return most recent).
Latch as a Connection that sits between a connection and a processor.
Automatic splitting when connecting single to multiple.
Allow connections single to multiplicative & singles.
Automatic latching when connecting to multiple.

Reload plugins.
Generalised plugin architecture (e.g. distance function plugins for SSM).

BUG: Referrals in Multiplicative doesn't update when one is deleted.

Multiplicity, multi-processor (then 3-band Bark summation on FFT for 8-channel spectral output).
- Connect single port to multi port.
- Should also be trivial to implement Klapuri.
- Load/save from Processor.
- Make graphics better.
- Need more useful way of determining buffersize (Mean with buffersize of 1 is no good)
  - Determine by incoming/outgoing buffers.

RMS.
Split Matrix kernel multiply from add.
Linear kernel.
Arrow kernel or some such.
128 sample step.

Range information & usage.
Move checkExit(), bail etc. into HeavyProcessor.

Scope -> Arity
Sample -> Vector
Element -> Real
