RMS.
Split Matrix kernel multiply from add.
Linear kernel.
Arrow kernel or some such.
128 sample step.

Multiplicity, multi-processor (then 3-band Bark summation on FFT for 8-channel spectral output).
- Should also be trivial to implement Klapuri.
Range information & usage.
Move checkExit(), bail etc. into HeavyProcessor.

Can't handle 48K rate.
Processor information - paused, cycles, CPU, samples read, ticker.
Buffer information.
Connection information.
