Sigmoid activator.
- Will have to track frequency.
- Probably best to use PeakRoller.

Minimum over T combined with activator function?

Rake-max with min-req activation energy searcher.
- Can return most certain periods w/probabilities.
- Multiple timespans.

Frequency sweep recogniser?

Peak finder has momentum.
- Getting vaguely to bottom drops it.
- Allows it to engulf minor peaks at either side.
- Record area, height (according to cubic interp), rel height (against shoulders)

Harmonic sounds analysis.
- Want a harmonics profile for each sound.
- More robust determination of frequency, and colation of all harmonics.
- Need to recognise low-frequency harmonic sounds.
  - Not to confuse with high-energy transient noise.
  - Greater accuracy required on harmonics fitting.

18+

Allow frequency as stream of subs.

Allow dragging of subprocs around.

Latcher - possibly as part of core (e.g. dump all samples on line except more recent - always return most recent).
Latch as a Connection that sits between a connection and a processor.
LxConnection::push needs to write Marks...


Automatic splitting when connecting single to multiple.
Allow connections single to multiplicative & singles.

Automatic latching when connecting to multiple?

Reload plugins.
Generalised plugin architecture (e.g. distance function plugins for SSM).

BUG: Referrals in Multiplicative doesn't update when one is deleted.

Multiplicity, multi-processor (then 3-band Bark summation on FFT for 8-channel spectral output).
- Connect single port to multi port.
- Should also be trivial to implement Klapuri.
- Load/save from Processor.
- Make graphics better.
- Need more useful way of determining buffersize (Mean with buffersize of 1 is no good)
  - Determine by incoming/outgoing buffers.

RMS.
Split Matrix kernel multiply from add.
Linear kernel.
Arrow kernel or some such.
128 sample step.

Range information & usage.
Move checkExit(), bail etc. into HeavyProcessor.

Sample -> Vector
